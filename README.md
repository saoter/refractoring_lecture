# Preparing machine learning code for deployment!
This has nothing to do with real life. 


This repository demonstrates how to prepare a working python code gethered in one file into deployment ready repository. Original file 'start.py' is located in 'not_in_use_anymore' folder. 

## Steps

### 1. Tarnsforming iris dataset into SQL database. 
The file is called 'iris_to_db.py' and is locating in folder 'pre_deployment'. 

### 2. Spliting the original file into 'model_training.py' and 'predict.py'. 

### 3. Creating file 'functions.py' for additional functionality.
